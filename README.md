# Target-SQL
Following are the actionable insights and recommendations to it:-
1. Actionable Insight -
If we check monthly sales of all years combined into their respective months then we can clearly see a seasonality effect in the numbers,
there is a sudden dip in sales from August which means that Target is doing good only in first 8 months for all the years.

As we have quite a good amount of festivals in last 4 months of year (September, October, November and specially December) then Target should 
leverage that time and execute good marketing during festival times for better sales, in this way sales for last 4 months will improve

2. Actionable Insight – customers tend to buy majorly in afternoon hours
as majorly customers are placing orders in afternoon hours Target can introduce a concept of happy hours in which either they can offer good 
discounts in these happy hours or provide deliveries at lower costs to increase sales

3. Actionable Insight – major customer base for Target is lying in three states of Brazil which are SP, RJ and MG as compared to others
Recommendation –
(i). Target should perform competitor analysis in the other states where its customer base is not that great (for example, GO,
 ES, DF, etc) and try to understand is there any competitor presence in those states because of which Target does not have good customer base,
also before doing competitor analysis check the population of those states once
(ii). If the population of the states where Target is not having good customer base is high, then Target can run Digital Media Campaign through
different channels like “Paid Social”, “Paid Search” and “Display” with an objective to increase Reach of the company in those states

4. Actionable Insight - Out of total 99441 orders delivered by Target in Brazil from 2016 to 2018, there are 473 orders (around 0.5%) for which
actual delivery happened late than estimated delivery

Recommendation – Target should monitor and find out the reason behind the delay happened for those orders so that they can mitigate that, as of 
now the percentage is not significant but if not investigated properly, the percentage can increase in future which will then lead to bad customer 
experience
